# TicTackToe

This is a simple tic-tac-toe game. 
The game allows for two players, with one being "O" and the other player being "X". 
The game is played on a normal 3x3 sized board. 
The game opens up into the lobby. In the lobby you are presented a menu of two options. 
These options are to continue to the game or to view the instructions of how to play if this is your first time playing tic-tac-toe.
